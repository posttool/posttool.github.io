<p><strong>This is Not a Machine Learning</strong></p>
<p>
Machine learning is huge. Blogs with new techniques related to modeling, composition and visualization emerge daily &mdash; amazing projects like <a href="http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/">Composing Music With Recurrent Neural Networks</a>. In considering ways to emulate sample material, machine learning and various forms of neural nets are amazing. It is amazing that a mental process could be emulated with a statistical model, given that there is enough sample data to get started. The machine learns from example. It has incredible implications. I suppose thats why so many are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/29/artificial-intelligence-strong-concern-bill-gates">concerned</a> that it might lead to our end. 
</p>
<p>
In my own work, I have had the opportunity to evaluate many machine learning libraries and paradigms as well as an amazing array of sample material that tends to accompany the theory. From large text corpora and image sets to bodies of recorded audio material, almost any large enough (and somewhat homogeneous) data set can be seen as material from which we can train a model. Machine learning attempts to generalize knowledge, sometimes with human supervision and sometimes without. We are coming up with a "forumla" from induction, not deduction. The results are mostly in the form of a prediction, given a similar situation.
</p>
<p>
In terms of creative output though, my concern is that we will continue to move into a realm where the statistical representation is what we deam acceptable. How do you chose the movies you watch on Netflix? The music you listen to on Spotify? I mean its cool that we can generate more statistical Mozart, but really, who cares? The interesting thing was Mozart, not the machine that can emulate him. 
</p>
<p>
This critique extends to much of the aesthetic of the new internet. It is statiscally driven for the most part. Too much consensus is not a good thing. Where is the risk? Machine learning is great for selection, but who is in charge of mutation and deduction? I believe that is our job. The instant you recognize that the machine can predict your tell, you will have no choice but to change it. Sure it might kill you, but that is at least a few decades away.
</p>
<p>
Until that time, we will always need to continue to create the "sample" material for future intelligent networks to "learn" from. I am not saying that this is potential training material &mdash; but it is derived from research and application of various forms of machine learning. If you look at the source you will notice that this is based on statistics and probabilities. Those "rules" are my choice. I suppose I could have composed music that more statically sounded like this and then trained a model, but that seems counter-intuitive.
</p>
<p>
Using the term “neural network” implicitly claims that these statistical models represent the brain or human intelligence. But really, that’s begging the question. The computer “neuron” is a metaphor. We named it this way because it does some things with results that are human-like and have configurations that are somewhat neuron-like. But there is really a loose relationship between the computer model and the brain. Are we discussing modeling the brain or are we honing statistical principles? Divergent goals that should be named appropriately and the implicatios of neural nets becoming artifically intelligent seems a little extreme.
</p>
<p>
All this said, in regards to the science, this critique is only semantic. I look forward to following the incredible work of those who are advancing the field. This audio/visual presentation is a meditation on the thinking expressed here.
